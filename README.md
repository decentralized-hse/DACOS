### Before you start server!

Please place .env in DACOS folder updating information about THIS_SERVER, ADMIN_SERVER, PORT and SECRET_KEY.

SECRET_KEY should be generated by you - it is used by Django.

PORT is where your server would start - gunicorn would map Django to that port.

THIS_SERVER is url and port of server where endpoints would be available.

ADMIN_SERVER is url and port of the admin server.

### Start

In order to start the server after creating .env file you should launch entrypoint_docker.sh which would 
create Docker image and start it, which would start 
the server and database in Docker and connect to the admin server.
